# Progressive Enhancement Project : "The Chinese Farmer"

This exercice was made by [**Bérengère Carpentier**](https://github.com/carpentierberengere/ "GitHub Profile").

Finished the **28th** of Octobre.

## What was asked ? 

We needed to re-create a webpage while following some instructions. 

## What did we do ? 

Using online ressources and given indications, we had to re-build a page from the ground up. We received the links, texts and pictures that we needed and, from those, made an HTML file, followed by a CSS file, that we later connected. 

## What did we learn ?

We learned some basic HTML and CSS commands, as well as some that were not that easy (Flexbox nearly made me *lose my mind*).

## What did we use ? 

* CSS3
* HTML5

## What does it look like ? 

This is not the whole thing, just a little preview !
